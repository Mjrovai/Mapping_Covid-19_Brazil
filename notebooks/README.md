1. At Terminal, having the file 'cv_util_func.py' (utility functions) at same directory, run script:

- $ python get_cv19_brazil.py

2. Having the file 'cv_util_func.py' (utility functions) at same directory, run the notebook:

- '10_Covid19_Brazil_Geo_Mapping_Analysis.ipynb'

3. Run only the notebook (used during developement phase):

- 30_Covid19_Brazil_Geo_Mapping_Analysis.ipynb
